I am writing to report an issue with a recent order, Order #98765, which I
received on December 15, 2025.

The item in question is the *'Medium Cotton Hoodie (Gray)'*. Upon reviewing

missing from the shipment*. I cross-referenced the packing slip, and while
the hoodie is listed, it was not physically present.

packing slip* for your review.

My preferred resolution is a *prompt shipment of the missing item* to my
address.

Please let me know the necessary steps to resolve this. Thank you for your
time and assistance.

Sincerely, [Your Name]
