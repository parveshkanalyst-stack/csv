Then you all started not supporting video without a subscription so I’m paying now. This is ridiculous and I feel extremely disappointed in my experience.

What are my options????( 12m 27s ) Arlo Support: I am sorry for the inconvenience that has caused to you, Mandy.( 14m 13s ) Mandy Holm: So what is the solution? Refund my subscription??!
